## What ClaraVerse Does

ClaraVerse is a complete AI workspace, not just a chatbot. Users self-host it on their own infrastructure and connect their own AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint).

### Features

- **Chat with Skills**: AI conversations with auto-activating tools -- web search, image generation, code execution, data analysis, document tools. No manual toggling.
- **Nexus (AI Task Management)**: A Trello-like Kanban board where AI is your team. Assign long-running tasks (research, coding, analysis), track progress through Draft → Queued → Working → Done → Failed columns.
- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Drag-and-drop automation builder with parallel execution, scheduling, API triggers, conditional logic, and 150+ integrations.
- **Routines**: Scheduled AI tasks that run on cron schedules and report results via Telegram.
- **Channels**: Telegram integration -- chat with Clara from your phone.
- **150+ Built-in Integrations**: Slack, GitHub, Jira, Google Sheets, Notion, Discord, HubSpot, Shopify, databases, and more. Connect once, use across Chat, Workflows, Nexus, and Routines.
- **Clara Companion (MCP Bridge)**: Go CLI that bridges local MCP servers (filesystem, git, memory) to ClaraVerse over WebSocket from any machine.
- **Artifacts**: AI-generated interactive content (charts, games, apps) rendered inline in chat.
- **Memory System**: Clara remembers context across conversations and auto-archives old memories.
- **Devices**: Connect multiple machines -- Clara reaches MCP servers on any of them remotely.
- **Browser-Local Storage**: Conversations stored in IndexedDB. Zero-knowledge architecture -- the server never stores chat history.
- **Multi-Provider**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, LM Studio, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- **BYOK**: Bring Your Own API Keys or use free local models.
- **Admin Panel**: User management, provider configuration, model controls, usage analytics.

### Architecture

- Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- Backend: Go (Fiber framework)
- Databases: MongoDB (data), MySQL (providers, models), Redis (jobs, pub/sub)
- Search: SearXNG (self-hosted, private)
- Deployment: Docker Compose

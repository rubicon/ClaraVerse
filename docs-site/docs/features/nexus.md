# Nexus -- Your Trello Board, But AI Is Your Team

![Nexus](/img/features/nexus.png)

Think of Nexus as Trello -- but instead of assigning cards to people, you assign them to AI. Clara is your team. Drop tasks onto the board, and she picks them up, works through them step by step, and moves them across columns as she progresses. Research, coding, data analysis, content writing -- delegate it all and watch the board update in real time.

## How It Works

1. Open **Nexus** from the sidebar.
2. Type your task in the input bar at the bottom of the Nexus view. Examples:
   - "Research the top 5 competitors in the project management space and summarize their pricing."
   - "Refactor the authentication module to use JWT refresh tokens."
   - "Analyze last quarter's sales CSV and highlight trends."
3. Clara picks up the task, works through it step by step, and moves it across the board as she progresses.

You assign the work. Clara does it. You review the results.

## The Kanban Board

Tasks flow through columns just like any project board:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Draft** | Task created but not yet submitted |
| **Queued** | Submitted and waiting to be picked up |
| **Working** | Clara is actively working on it |
| **Done** | Completed and ready for your review |
| **Failed** | Task encountered an error and could not complete |

Click any task card to see the full execution log -- every step Clara took, every tool she called, every decision she made. Full transparency, no black box.

## Projects

Group related tasks into **Projects** to keep your board organized. A project might be "Q1 Marketing Research" or "Backend Refactor." Filter the board by project to focus on what matters.

## What Makes It Powerful

- **Delegate real work.** These are not quick chat replies. Nexus handles tasks that take minutes or hours -- research reports, code refactors, data analysis.
- **Full transparency.** Every action Clara takes is logged. You see exactly what she did and why.
- **150+ integrations.** Clara can pull GitHub issues, read Google Sheets, post to Slack -- all while working on your tasks.
- **Multi-step reasoning.** Clara breaks complex requests into subtasks and executes them sequentially, just like a team member would.

## Tips

- **Be specific.** "Analyze sales data" is okay. "Analyze Q4 sales from the attached CSV, compare month-over-month growth, and flag any product with declining revenue" is better.
- **Check in on progress.** Click a running task to see live updates and intermediate results.
- **Combine with Routines.** Schedule recurring tasks using Routines so they run automatically on a schedule.

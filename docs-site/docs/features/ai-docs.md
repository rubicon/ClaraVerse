# AI Docs

ClaraVerse includes built-in tools for processing documents with AI assistance. Upload PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, CSV files, and other document types, then analyze, summarize, transform, or extract data from them directly in chat.

## Supported Document Types

| Format | What You Can Do |
|--------|----------------|
| **PDF** | Summarize, extract text, answer questions about content, pull out tables |
| **PowerPoint (PPT/PPTX)** | Analyze slides, extract key points, generate speaker notes, restructure content |
| **CSV** | Analyze data, generate statistics, filter rows, create charts, find patterns |
| **Other formats** | Text files, code files, and other common formats can also be uploaded and processed |

## How to Use It

1. **Upload** a document in the chat by clicking the attachment button or dragging the file into the conversation.
2. **Ask Clara** what you want to do with it.

**Example prompts:**

- "Summarize this PDF in 5 bullet points"
- "What are the key takeaways from this presentation?"
- "Analyze this CSV and tell me which product had the highest revenue"
- "Extract all email addresses from this document"
- "Create a chart from column B vs column D in this spreadsheet"

## Key Capabilities

- **Summarization** -- Get concise summaries of long documents.
- **Q&A** -- Ask specific questions and get answers grounded in the document content.
- **Data analysis** -- Upload CSV or tabular data and get statistical insights, trends, and visualizations.
- **Content extraction** -- Pull out specific information like tables, names, dates, or figures.
- **Transformation** -- Convert document content into different formats (bullet points, tables, structured data).

## Tips

- For large PDFs, ask Clara to focus on specific sections or page ranges to get more precise answers.
- When working with CSV data, mention the column names or describe the data so Clara can orient itself quickly.
- You can upload multiple documents in the same conversation and ask Clara to compare or cross-reference them.
- AI Docs works with any model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.) -- just make sure you have a model selected in your chat.

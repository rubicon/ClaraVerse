# Interactive Artifacts

Clara can generate interactive content -- images, charts, games, mini-apps -- and render them directly inside the chat. Instead of getting a code block you have to copy and run somewhere else, you get a live, usable result right where you asked for it.

## What Gets Rendered

- **Images** -- AI-generated images displayed inline.
- **Charts and graphs** -- Data visualizations you can hover over and inspect.
- **Mini-apps** -- Small interactive applications (calculators, converters, forms).
- **Games** -- Playable demos generated from a prompt.
- **HTML/CSS/JS previews** -- Live-rendered web content.

## How to Use It

Just ask Clara to create something visual or interactive. There is no special syntax or mode to enable.

**Example prompts:**

- "Create a bar chart comparing these sales numbers: Q1 120, Q2 185, Q3 210, Q4 160"
- "Build a simple Pomodoro timer app"
- "Make a tic-tac-toe game I can play"
- "Generate an image of a mountain landscape at sunset"

Clara produces the artifact and embeds it in the conversation. You can interact with it immediately.

## Managing Artifacts

All artifacts you create are collected in the Artifacts gallery within Chat. You can:

- **View** any artifact by scrolling through the conversation, revisiting the chat, or opening the Artifacts gallery within Chat.
- **Interact** with charts, games, and apps directly in the embedded preview.
- **Iterate** by asking Clara to modify the artifact ("make the chart use a pie layout instead" or "add a reset button to the game").

## Tips

- Be specific about what you want. "Bar chart" vs. "line chart" vs. "pie chart" gives Clara clear direction.
- You can ask Clara to refine artifacts iteratively -- change colors, add labels, fix behavior.
- Interactive artifacts work best for self-contained content. For complex multi-page apps, consider using Workflows instead.
- Artifacts are stored in your conversation history and persist when you revisit the chat.

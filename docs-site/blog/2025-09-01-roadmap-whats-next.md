# The Road Ahead: ClaraVerse Is Becoming the Operating System for AI Work

We started ClaraVerse with a straightforward goal: give people a self-hosted AI workspace they actually own. No vendor lock-in, no data leaving your machine, no surprises on your bill. Just a powerful, open source AI agent platform that runs wherever you want it to.

A lot has shipped since then. We are just getting started.

## What Is Already Live

Before we talk about what is next, here is what you can use right now in ClaraVerse:

- **Chat with auto-activating skills** -- Start a conversation and ClaraVerse automatically detects when a skill should fire. No manual toggling, no slash commands. It just works.
- **Visual workflow builder** -- Drag, drop, and connect nodes to build automations. Need help? The AI-assisted generation can scaffold entire workflows from a prompt.
- **Nexus Kanban board** -- This is the Trello-for-AI vision, and it is live. Create boards, organize AI tasks into columns, and let agents work through them. Task management meets intelligent automation.
- **150+ built-in integrations** -- Connect to the tools you already use without hunting for plugins.
- **Clara Companion MCP bridge** -- Bridge ClaraVerse capabilities into any MCP-compatible client.
- **Telegram channels** -- Deploy agents directly to Telegram so they can interact with users outside the workspace.
- **Routines** -- Schedule automations to run on a cadence. Daily summaries, weekly reports, recurring data pulls -- set it and forget it.
- **Memory system** -- Agents remember context across sessions. Conversations build on each other instead of starting from scratch.
- **Multi-provider support** -- Bring your own model. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama -- use whatever fits your needs, swap freely.
- **Zero-knowledge browser-local storage** -- Your data stays on your machine. We never see it, we never store it, we never will.

That is not a roadmap. That is what is shipping today.

## What Is Coming Next

### Mobile App

ClaraVerse should go where you go. We are building a native mobile experience so you can chat with agents, check on workflows, and manage Nexus boards from your phone. Same workspace, smaller screen, full control.

### Marketplace and Plugin Store

A community marketplace where anyone can share skills, workflows, and integrations they have built. Think of it as an app store for your AI workspace:

- Publish a workflow that automates invoice processing
- Share a skill that connects to a niche API
- Download a ready-made Nexus board template for content planning

The best AI workspace is one shaped by the people who use it.

## The Bigger Vision

Here is what we are building toward: **ClaraVerse as the operating system for AI work.**

One self-hosted workspace where you chat, automate, delegate, and schedule -- all without leaving. Not disconnected tools glued together with API calls, but a single surface where AI agents, workflows, task boards, and communication channels are native citizens.

You open ClaraVerse in the morning. Your [routines](/docs/features/routines) have already pulled overnight data. Your [Nexus board](/docs/features/nexus) shows what your agents accomplished and what needs your attention. You [chat](/docs/features/chat) with an agent to refine a report, then kick off a [workflow](/docs/features/workflows) to distribute it. Everything stays on your infrastructure, under your control.

That is the vision. And with Nexus, Routines, Workflows, and 150+ integrations already live, we are closer than you might think.

## Built in the Open

ClaraVerse is open source and it will stay that way. Every feature on this roadmap will ship as open source code that you can run, modify, and extend.

We believe the best AI tools are the ones communities build together. If you have ideas, bug reports, or want to contribute code, the doors are open:

- **Star and fork** the [ClaraVerse repository on GitHub](https://github.com/badboysm890/ClaraVerse)
- **Open an issue** to suggest features or report bugs
- **Submit a pull request** -- contributions of all sizes are welcome

## Final Thoughts

We are two builders -- [badboysm890](https://github.com/badboysm890) and [aruntemme](https://github.com/aruntemme) -- who believe AI tooling should be open, self-hosted, and community-driven. This roadmap is not a promise deck for investors. It is a public commitment to the people who use ClaraVerse every day.

If you have been looking for an open source AI workspace that respects your data and grows with your needs, [give ClaraVerse a try](https://github.com/badboysm890/ClaraVerse). And if you like what you see, come build with us.

The road ahead is wide open.
